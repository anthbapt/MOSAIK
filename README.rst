Introduction:
===============
In King's College London at the `Spatial Biology Facility <https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/facilities/the-spatial-biology-facility>`_, we utilise both CosMx and Xenium technologies. The data is then integrated into a Python workflow, allowing us to fully leverage the spatial biology aspects and facilitate multimodal integration.

üéØ Roadmap
====

Numerical materials:
--------------------
* `Napari v0.4.17 <https://github.com/napari/napari/releases/tag/v0.4.17>`_ + CosMx plugin (**napari/napari_CosMx-0.4.17.3-py3-none-any.whl**)
* CosMx/Xenium conda environment (**env/cosmx.yml**)
* CosMx/Xenium Reader (**src/reader/**)
* CosMx/Xenium QC scripts (**src/qc/**)
* CosMx/Xenium resegmentation scripts (**src/segmentation/**)
* CosMx Cell composition code (**src/composition/**)
* CosMx/Xenium analysis codes (**src/analysis/**)


Integration workflow:

How using Napari:
--------------------

1. Install Napari 0.4.17.
2. Launch Napari and open the IPython console window (indicated by the symbol "**>_**").
3. Install the CosMx-plugin with the following command:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install napari_CosMx-0.4.17.3-py3-none-any.whl

4. Drag the napari_cosmx_launcher folder into the Napari window. You can download the folder from this `link <https://emckclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/k2481276_kcl_ac_uk/EkO8xJFpX8ZBv_lq-5zRHQQBjcoTOE8PONclhqUfj20zSw?e=WtIiKX>`_
5. In the right panel, browse to and select the parent folder that contains your CosMx run.
6. Choose the output folder.
7. Launch the stitching by pressing the "**Stitch**" button.
8. Wait until the stitching process finishes. There is no indicator that shows the stitching is running, except for the loading cursor. Therefore, avoid clicking the "**Stitch**" button multiple times. Once the stitching is complete, a message will appear in the right panel.
9. When the stitching is finished, the output directory contains an "**images**" folder with all the FOVs across different fluorescent channels, and a "**targets.hdf5**" file that stores the transcripts.
10. To load your Napari project, restart Napari 0.4.17 and drag the project folder, which contains both the "**images**" folder and the "**targets.hdf5**" file into the Napari window.

11. When the project folder is loaded, several panels allow the user to visualize the different information from the CosMx run:


    * **Morphology Images** panel allows adding fluorescent channels (panel on the right).
    * **RNA Transcripts** panel allows adding transcripts (panel on the right).
    * **Layer list** allows controlling the different objects, including transcripts, fluorescent channels, and segmentation (panel on the left).
    * **Layer controls** panel allows adjusting the visualization of the different objects (panel on the left).


SpatialData object overview:
------------------------------

The purpose of the **SpatialData** object is to lay the foundation for methods and pipelines to analyse spatial omics data.

We can think of a **SpatialData object** as a container for various **Elements**. An **Element** is either a **SpatialElement** (Images, Labels, Points, Shapes) or a **Table**.

Below is a brief description of each:

- **Images**: H&E or other staining images.
- **Labels**: Pixel-level segmentation maps.
- **Points**: Transcript locations with gene information, or landmark points.
- **Shapes**: Cell or nucleus boundaries, subcellular structures, anatomical annotations, or regions of interest (ROIs).
- **Tables**: Sparse or dense matrices annotating SpatialElements or storing arbitrary (non-spatial) metadata. They do not contain spatial coordinates.

We can categorise the **SpatialElements** into two broad types:

- **Rasters**: Data made up of pixels, including Images and Labels.
- **Vectors**: Data made up of points and lines. (Polygons are considered vectors, as they are simply a list of connected points.) Points and Shapes belong to this category.

However we can go from one type of object into another by the two following processes:

- **Vectorization**: The process where each label value (i.e., an integer value greater than 0) is converted into a `shapely` Polygon or MultiPolygon. This corresponds to the conversion of Labels into Shapes.
- **Rasterization**: The creation of a 2D image that represents geometries (polygons, multipolygons, points). This corresponds to the conversion of Shapes (or Points) into Labels.


Finally, it is possible to visually interact with a **SpatialData** object, through the **spatialdata-napari** plugin.
