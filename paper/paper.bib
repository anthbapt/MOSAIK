abstract={Spatially resolved omics technologies are transforming our understanding of biological tissues. However, the handling of uni- and multimodal spatial omics datasets remains a challenge owing to large data volumes, heterogeneity of data types and the lack of flexible, spatially aware data structures. Here we introduce SpatialData, a framework that establishes a unified and extensible multiplatform file-format, lazy representation of larger-than-memory data, transformations and alignment to common coordinate systems. SpatialData facilitates spatial annotations and cross-modal aggregation and analysis, the utility of which is illustrated in the context of multiple vignettes, including integrative analysis on a multimodal Xenium and Visium breast cancer study.},

In less than a decade, the field has seen tremendous technological revolutions that enable crucial new insights into the interplay between intracellular and intercellular molecular mechanisms that govern development, physiology and pathogenesis. In this Review, we highlight advances in the fast-developing field of single-cell and spatial multi-omics technologies (also known as multimodal omics approaches), and the computational strategies needed to integrate information across these molecular layers. We demonstrate their impact on fundamental cell biology and translational research, discuss current challenges and provide an outlook to the future.},

	abstract = {The basis of cellular function is where and when proteins are expressed and in what quantities. Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) experiments quantify the copy number and location of mRNA molecules; however, the numbers of RNA species that can be simultaneously measured by smFISH has been limited. Using combinatorial labeling with error-robust encoding schemes, Chen et al. simultaneously imaged 100 to 1000 RNA species in a single cell. Such large-scale detection allows regulatory interactions to be analyzed at the transcriptome scale. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aaa6090 A single-molecule imaging method allows simultaneous measurement of 1000 RNA species in single cells. Knowledge of the expression profile and spatial landscape of the transcriptome in individual cells is essential for understanding the rich repertoire of cellular behaviors. Here, we report multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a single-molecule imaging approach that allows the copy numbers and spatial localizations of thousands of RNA species to be determined in single cells. Using error-robust encoding schemes to combat single-molecule labeling and detection errors, we demonstrated the imaging of 100 to 1000 distinct RNA species in hundreds of individual cells. Correlation analysis of the {\textasciitilde}104 to 106 pairs of genes allowed us to constrain gene regulatory networks, predict novel functions for many unannotated genes, and identify distinct spatial distribution patterns of RNAs that correlate with properties of the encoded proteins.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is presently the most predominant tumor type and the second leading cause of tumor-related deaths among women. Although advancements in diagnosis and therapeutics have momentously improved, chemoresistance remains an important challenge. Tumors oppose chemotherapeutic agents through a variety of mechanisms, with studies revealing that the tumor microenvironment (TME) is central to this process. The components of TME including stromal cells, immune cells, and non-stromal factors on exposure to chemotherapy promote the acquisition of resistant phenotype. Consequently, limited targeting of tumor cells leads to tumor recurrence after chemotherapy. Here, in this article, we summarize how TME alters chemotherapy responses in breast cancer. Furthermore, the role of different stromal cells viz., CAFs, TAMs, MSCs, endothelial cells, and cancer stem cells (CSC) in breast cancer chemoresistance is discussed in greater detail.},
